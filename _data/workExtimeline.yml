  description: <ul><li>I'm currently a part of the Tufts Neutrino Group, working under <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/physics/people/faculty/wongjirad"> Dr. Taritree Wongjirad </a> on the MicroBoone experiment.</li>
              <li>I'm designing a continuous conditional Generative Adversial Network (cGAN) that can be used to simulate neutrino events.</li>
              <li>I'm also a junior investigator at <a href = "https://iaifi.org/people.html"> IAIFI.</a> </li></ul>

  description: <ul><li>I implemented Single Image Super Resolution Convolution Neural Networks to downsample Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fields of Bay of
                Bengal from a spatial resolution of 15 km to 5km and 5km to 1km. </li> <li>I trained the Very Deep Super Resolution Convolution Neural Network (VDSR).</li>
                <li>The network achieved a Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) Gain of 12 between input and expected resolution. </li> <li>The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was in the order of 0.0001 degrees Celsius between the predicted and expected resolution.</li></ul>

  description: <ul> <li>I built a pipeline capable of detecting six classes of wrinkles on human faces irrespective of their age, gender or face tone. </li>
                <li> Since wrinkles are faint, I experimented with image processing techniques like Binarization, Gaussian Filter and Hessian Line Tracking in order to highlight them.</li>
                <li>Certain wrinkles (like those around the eyes) are more common than others. I selected the RetinaNet architecture to tackle the imbalanced dataset.</li>
                <li>The pipeline achieved a Mean Average Precision (maP) of 0.5. It was deployed on the <a href="https://cureskin.com/">CureSkin</a> application, with over a million downloads.</li></ul>

  description: <ul> <li>I worked on a service for JioLiv.</li> <li>I devised an intelligent algorithm based on structural similarity index to filter out non-redundant movie frames.</li>
                <li>I implemented a Tensorflow-based text detection and recognition pipeline to read words off the movie frames.</li>
                <li>Subsequently, I formulated a logic using spaCy and TextRank to extract contextually significant phrases (single-worded or multi-worded) from the generated text.</li></ul>

  description: <ul> <li>I built a pipeline to detect price tags from images of supermarket shelves and interpret prices from them.</li>
              <li>To detect minuscule price tags, the Single Shot Object Detector based on Feature Pyramid Network was implemented.</li>
              <li>A YOLO-based Multi-Digit Classifier was trained to read digits off the price tags.</li>
              <li>The entire pipeline achieved a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.6, and is being deployed by Xplorazzi Technologies. <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/price-tag-detector-multi-digit-classification-using-tensorflow-object-detection-and-svhn-38506705bcf2">[View Details]</a> </li></ul>
