description: AMC taught me a lot about finances (and student politics :P). But no kidding, each decision here directly affects 150 workers and 4000 students. Moreover, we’re dealing with an annual budget of INR 14 crore! During my tenure, I contributed to the formulation of the education reimbursement and annual salary increment policy. At BITS Pilani, the girls’ hostel is way far from the academic building. To make girls’ lives easier, I introduced a guideline that allowed them to eat in boys’ hostels (closer to the academic building) during the examination week. The best part of AMC, however, was being a member of the Menu committee as it’s always great to be in charge of what you’ll eat at the mess next week xD.
