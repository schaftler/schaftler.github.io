description: As a member of Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem, I have implemented the Murrell Version of Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the attitude of the nanosatellite.  I studied orbital mechanics, quaternions (for attitude representation), attitude kinematics and dynamics for the same. Team Anant is a student-run technical team working to build a 3U Cubesat.
