description: Youth Service America provides grants to selected Indians to drive a campaign for road safety in their city. In 2016, I was the youngest grantee appointed! Under my leadership, many activities were organized, from health checkups of over 70 school bus drivers to auditing the busiest roads in my town. (The audited data was uploaded to Google Maps). We set up stalls in carnivals at different schools and organized poster-making and essay writing competitions (footfall of over 600 students). We also staged road plays during the evenings to catch the general public's eye. The grant (USD 750) was awarded by Underwriter Laboratories (UL) in partnership with Youth Service America (YSA).
