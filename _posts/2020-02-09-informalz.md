description: From <i>Treasure Hunt</i> to <i>Beg Borrow Steal</i> to <i>Human Foosball</i>, we, at Informalz, organize the kind of events anyone will fall in love with. I won’t call what we do “work” as it’s more about trying out different game variations and choosing the most fun one. As the coordinator, I was in charge of all department activities for the technical fest of our college, APOGEE’21 (held virtually). I led a group of over 35 people as we brainstormed activities we could organize (for the first time, in an online mode) for over 1500 participants.
